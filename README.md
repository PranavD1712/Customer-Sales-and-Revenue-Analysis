**Key Business Insights:**
* High sales do not always translate into high profit.
  Technology category generates the highest profit.
* Furniture category is frequently loss-making.
* Profit margins decline sharply at higher discount levels.
* Majority of customers are one-time buyers.
* A small group of customers contributes disproportionately to revenue.





###### **Business Value:**
This analysis helps organizations:
Identify loss-making products and regions
