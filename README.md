### Project Phases

- Data Understanding – Reviewing dataset structure and variables  
- Data Cleaning – Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies  
- Feature Engineering – Creating profit margin indicators, flags, and customer frequency metrics  
- Exploratory Data Analysis – Examining sales, profit trends, discount effects, customer activity, and regional patterns  
- Business Insights and Recommendations – Converting analysis into actionable findings  
- Power BI Dashboard – Building an interactive dashboard for visualization and monitoring KPIs

### Power BI Dashboard Highlights

- KPI cards showing total sales, total profit, profit margin, and loss orders  
- Sales and profit trend analysis over time  
- Category and sub-category performance evaluation  
- Regional profitability comparison  
- Customer contribution and purchase frequency analysis

### Key Business Insights

- High sales volumes do not always correspond to higher profitability.  
- The Technology category contributes the highest overall profit.  
- Furniture products frequently generate losses.  
- Higher discount levels significantly reduce profit margins.  
- Most customers make only a single purchase.  
- A relatively small group of customers accounts for a large share of total revenue.

### Business Value

This analysis supports organizations in:

- Identifying loss-making products, regions, and strategies  
- Improving pricing and discount decisions  
- Focusing on valuable customer segments  
- Making data-driven decisions to enhance profitability
